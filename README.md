# Machine Learning
Repo for machine learning projects I've as part of class assignments.

The projects in this repository primarily focus on image processing and machine learning. Techniques used include:

1. **Image Filtering**: Gaussian and median filters are applied to images for edge detection and noise reduction.

2. **Machine Learning Classification**: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests are used for classifying images of simulated proton-proton LHC collisions.

3. **Deep Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are employed to enhance the classification performance, capturing intricate hierarchical features within the images.

4. **Image Retrieval**: Techniques like resizing images to tiny images and using them as feature vectors for image retrieval are demonstrated.

5. **Data Visualization**: The projects make extensive use of data visualization libraries like Matplotlib for displaying images and results.

6. **Preprocessing**: Image normalization and one-hot encoding of labels are some of the preprocessing steps performed.

These techniques provide a comprehensive approach to tackling complex image processing and machine learning tasks.
