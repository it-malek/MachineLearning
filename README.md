# Machine Learning Projects - Image Processing & Classification

## Introduction:

This repository showcases my machine learning projects focused on image processing and classification, completed as part of class assignments. The projects explore various techniques to analyze and classify images.

## Key Techniques:

- Image Preprocessing: Techniques like image normalization and one-hot encoding prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.
- Image Filtering: Gaussian and median filters are applied for noise reduction and edge detection within images.
- Machine Learning Classification: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests are used to classify images, such as simulated proton-proton LHC collisions.
- Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed to extract complex features and improve classification accuracy.
- Image Retrieval: Techniques are explored to efficiently retrieve similar images based on their features.
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib libraries are used to effectively visualize images and project results.
Benefits:

These projects demonstrate a comprehensive approach to tackling image processing and machine learning challenges. By combining various techniques, you gain the ability to analyze and classify images for diverse applications.
